# Boombikes-LinearRegression-Assignment 
> Linear Regression performed on the Boombikes bike rental dataset as part of an assignment for coursework in the course Advance Cerificate Program in Data Science (Bootcamp).

## General Information
- Multiple linear regression is performed on the dataset.
- The project is done as part of coursework in the Machine Learning module. 
- We are trying to find the number of rentals issued from the company based on numerous independent values such as temperature, weather, humidity, holiday, etc. 
- The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used. 
- The dependent/target varibale in the data set is cnt(count).


## Technologies Used
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- sci-kit learn
- numpy


## Conclusions
- The R-squared value of the train set is 83.92% whereas the test set has a value of 80.14% which suggests that our model broadly explains the variance quite accurately on the test set and thus we can conclude that it is a good model.

- The p-values and VIF were used to select the significant variables. RFE was also conducted for automated selection of variables.

- The major steps included in the python notebook are data interpretation, data visualisation, data pre-processing, model training, feature selection, residual analysis, model evaluation on the test set. 

- Concepts such as EDA, p-value, VIF, RFE were used and model building was done using statsmodels library.
